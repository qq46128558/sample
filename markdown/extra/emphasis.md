Markdown Extra wonâ€™t convert underscores to emphasis because they are in the middle of the word. 

Please open the folder "secret_magic_box".

Emphasis with underscore still works as long as you emphasize whole words like this:

I like it when you say _you love me_.

The same apply for strong emphasis: with Markdown Extra, you can no longer set strong emphasis in the middle of a word using underscores, you must do so using asterisks as emphasis markers.

Please open the folder "secret*magic*box".
